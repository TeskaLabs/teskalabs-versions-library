# TeskaLabs Versions Library


This library provides a layer containing Version files only.
By adding this layer to ie. TeskaLabs LogMan.io, new version files can be updated automagically in the installation while _LogMan.io Common Library_ and _ASAB Maestro Library_ keep pinned to a specific version.
